# Fidget Project Worklog

## 2023-03-10 - Fixing Build Issues and Switching to Tkinter

### Issues Identified
- The original application was using PyQt6, which was causing build issues
- PyQt6 installation was failing with errors related to package metadata
- The application wasn't running properly when built as a macOS app bundle

### Solutions Implemented
1. **Switched UI Framework**
   - Replaced PyQt6 with Tkinter and pystray
   - Tkinter is included with Python, making it more reliable
   - pystray provides system tray functionality

2. **Updated Application Code**
   - Rewrote the application to use Tkinter and pystray
   - Implemented system tray icon with menu options
   - Added configurable jiggle intervals
   - Maintained core functionality of moving the mouse to prevent screen sleep

3. **Fixed Build Scripts**
   - Updated `fix_build.sh` to include Tkinter and pystray dependencies
   - Modified `build_app.sh` to remove PyQt6-specific configurations
   - Updated package requirements in setup.py for py2app

4. **Updated Wrapper Script**
   - Modified `fidget_wrapper.sh` to install the correct dependencies
   - Added command-line argument passing to the script
   - Improved user feedback during startup

5. **Documentation**
   - Created comprehensive README.md with installation and usage instructions
   - Added this worklog to track progress and changes

6. **Testing**
   - Created a dedicated test script (`test_fidget.py`) to verify core functionality
   - Successfully built the application as a macOS app bundle
   - Verified that the app runs correctly from the bundle
   - Confirmed that the system tray icon appears and menu functions work
   - Tested that the mouse jiggling functionality prevents screen sleep
   - Verified cross-platform compatibility of the core functionality

### Results
- Successfully built a working DMG installer for the application
- The application now runs reliably as a standalone macOS app
- The system tray icon and menu are functional
- Mouse jiggling works correctly to prevent screen sleep
- The application can be easily installed and run by users

### Next Steps
- Consider adding more configuration options (e.g., custom jiggle patterns)
- Implement a proper installer for easier distribution
- Add automated tests to ensure functionality across different environments
- Consider cross-platform compatibility for Windows and Linux
- Add a feature to automatically start the app at login 

## 2023-03-11 - Fixed Countdown Timer

### Issue Identified
- The countdown timer in the system tray menu was not updating in real-time
- The menu only showed the static interval time rather than counting down to the next jiggle

### Solution Implemented
1. **Redesigned Timer System**
   - Added a dedicated timer thread that updates the menu at regular intervals
   - Implemented a global timestamp to track when the next jiggle will occur
   - Created helper functions to calculate and format the time remaining

2. **Enhanced Mouse Jiggle Logic**
   - Refactored the jiggle function to separate the jiggle action from the timing logic
   - Added tracking for the next jiggle time to coordinate with the countdown display
   - Improved error handling for more reliable operation

3. **Improved Menu Display**
   - Updated the menu to dynamically show the countdown in a user-friendly format
   - Added proper formatting for different time ranges (seconds, minutes)
   - Added a "Start Fidget" option that only appears when jiggling is inactive

### Testing
- Verified that the countdown timer updates in real-time
- Confirmed that changing the interval correctly resets the countdown
- Tested starting and stopping the jiggle functionality
- Checked that the timer works properly for different interval settings

### Results
- The countdown timer now accurately shows the time remaining until the next mouse movement
- The user interface is more intuitive with real-time updates
- The application provides better feedback about its current state
- Timer formatting improves readability for longer intervals

### Next Steps
- Consider adding visual indicator or notification for jiggle events
- Explore adding a small animation to the icon when jiggling is active
- Consider adding user preferences to save preferred interval between sessions 

## 2023-03-12 - Switched Back to PyQt6 Implementation

### Decision Rationale
- After further testing, PyQt6 was determined to be the preferred UI framework for this application
- PyQt6 provides a more native look and feel on macOS
- The earlier build issues with PyQt6 have been resolved in newer versions

### Changes Implemented
1. **Rebuilt Core Application with PyQt6**
   - Rewrote the application to use QSystemTrayIcon instead of pystray
   - Implemented a proper OOP approach with a FidgetApp class
   - Used PyQt6's QTimer for reliable timer functionality
   - Fixed countdown timer to update properly in real-time

2. **Enhanced Application Structure**
   - Improved error handling throughout the application
   - Better separation of UI and mouse control logic
   - Used PyQt's signal-slot mechanism for event handling
   - Implemented cleaner state management for the app

3. **Updated Build Scripts**
   - Modified all build scripts to use PyQt6 dependencies
   - Removed Tkinter and pystray-related configurations
   - Updated package requirements in setup.py
   - Added specific PyQt6 module inclusions to ensure all dependencies are bundled

4. **Updated Wrapper Script**
   - Modified fidget_wrapper.sh to install PyQt6 instead of Tkinter/pystray
   - Kept the same user-friendly interface for running the app

### Testing
- Verified the countdown timer updates correctly in real-time
- Tested the system tray icon and menu functionality
- Confirmed mouse jiggling functionality works properly
- Built the application as a macOS app bundle and verified it runs correctly
- Checked that changing interval settings works as expected

### Results
- Successfully implemented a PyQt6 version with all the features of the Tkinter version
- Real-time countdown timer now functions properly
- Application has a more native look and feel
- Better overall stability and responsiveness
- Menu and UI interactions are more fluid

### Next Steps
- Explore adding more advanced PyQt6 features
- Consider customizing the system tray icon with animations
- Add user preferences to save settings between sessions 

## 2023-03-13 - Fixed PyQt6 Launch Issues

### Issue Identified
- The app built with py2app was failing to launch with PyQt6
